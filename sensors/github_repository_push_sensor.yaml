  Sensor which monitors Github repository for "pushed_at" changes.
  This is better than the "repository_event" trigger type because it is not impacted by the delay between the real activity and the event being generated.
  There can be a delay of 5 minutes and up to 5 seconds between the real activity and the event being generated.
# requires authentication because of GitHub rate limiting
# use default with auth or increase poll interval
